>#### A basic theremin developed for use with the leap motion controller.

###How does it work?:
The leap motion controller measures your hand's x, y and z co-ordinates. The initial oscillated note has been run through a series of audio processors. Specifically, movement change on the x-axis changes the frequency of the note, y-axis adjusts the gain and z-axis adjusts the delay.

###Instructions:
  
* Ensure leap motion controller is connected to computer
* Clone this repo to your local storage
* Start an instance of localhost in root of cloned repo and go to browser
* Press the begin button to start the oscillator
* Guide your hand over the leap motion controller to mould the sound
* Press pause button to stop the oscillator

###Technologies Used:

* Leap Motion Controller
* Leap JS
* Angular JS
* Web Audio API
* HTML5 Canvas
* Vanilla JavaScript

Please note that this is an MVP designed primarily to test the leap motion controller and experiment around with the awesome API that is Web Audio!
